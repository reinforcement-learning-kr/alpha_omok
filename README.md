# alpha-omok
This is a project of [Reinforcement Learning KR group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ReinforcementLearningKR/).

### Project objective
AlphaZero is Reinforcement Learning algorithm which is effectively combine MCTS(Monte-Carlo Tree Search) with Actor-Critic. Our objective is to train AlphaZero and apply it to Omok (Gomoku)  

There are 4 little objectives to achieve  
1. MCTS on Tic-Tac-Toe
2. MCTS on Omok
3. AlphaZero on Omok
4. upload AlphaGo Zero on web
